# Python-Work
Showcases two Python programs written by me:
1. The first program is titled "myplayer.py" which simulates a music player.
2. The second program is titled "pig.py" which simulates a user and CPU playing a dice game.
   Here is a description of Pig: Pig is a game that has two players that alternate turns rolling dice. In our case, there will be one human player and one computer player. Each playerâ€™s goal is to get 100 points rolled on a normal six-sided die first. Each turn consists of the rolling the die repeatedly until you decide to stop or until you roll a 1. If a 1 is rolled, the player gets zero points for that round
